  # Set the logging level to debug, info, warn, error, or fatal. The debug
  # level logs all XML sent and received by the server.
  # If you want logging to STDOUT remove the path
  # e.g. `log 'log/vines.log' do` becomes `log do`

  # This is optional and defaults to the conf/certs directory created during
  # `vines init`.

  # Each host element below is a virtual host domain name that this server will
  # service. Hosts can share storage configurations or use separate databases.
  # TLS encryption is mandatory so each host must have a <domain>.crt and
  # <domain>.key file in the conf/certs directory. A self-signed certificate can
  # be generated for a virtual host domain with the 'vines cert <domain.tld>'
  # command. Change the example, 'wonderland.lit', domain name to your actual
  # domain.
  #
  # The vines gem is distributed with a single 'fs' filesystem storage backend.
  # Additional database support is provided by the vines-sql, vines-redis,
  # vines-couchdb, and vines-mongodb gems.
  #
  # The private_storage attribute allows clients to store XML fragments
  # on the server, using the XEP-0049 Private XML Storage feature.
  #
  # The pubsub attribute defines the XEP-0060 Publish-Subscribe services hosted
  # at these virtual host domains. In the example below, pubsub services are
  # available at games.wonderland.lit and scores.wonderland.lit as well as
  # games.verona.lit and scores.verona.lit.
  #
  # Shared storage example:
  # host 'verona.lit', 'wonderland.lit' do
  #   private_storage false
  #   cross_domain_messages false
  #   storage 'fs' do
  #     dir 'data'
  #   end
  #   components 'tea'  => 'secr3t',
  #              'cake' => 'passw0rd'
  #   pubsub 'games', 'scores'
  # end

    # pubsub 'games', 'scores'
  end

  # Hosts can use LDAP authentication that overrides the authentication
  # provided by a storage database. If LDAP is in use, passwords are not
  # saved or validated against the storage database. However, all other user
  # information, like rosters, is still saved in the storage database.
  #
